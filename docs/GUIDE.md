# Helix Foundry guide

This guide is the detailed companion to the [README](../README.md). It covers what Helix Foundry does, how to connect each kind of source, how AI and review work, how the services fit together, and how to develop and test the code. To install it, start with the README or the [agent runbook](../AGENTS.md). To run an installation day to day, see [operations](OPERATIONS.md).

## Features

Helix Foundry is an AI-assisted data workspace that runs on your own computer, built on HelixDB and DuckDB. You connect data, confirm a suggested ontology or describe an outcome, inspect tested proposals, and publish a shared ontology with key metrics on Home. Local inference is the default; Claude and OpenAI are explicit alternatives.

- **Sources:** PostgreSQL and MySQL discovery and streamed snapshot ingestion, sign-in for Neon, Supabase and PlanetScale, Stripe, WorkOS and PostHog, REST pagination, S3-compatible file imports, CSV, JSON, JSONL and Parquet uploads, and a batch ingestion API.
- **Data:** immutable Parquet snapshots, profiles, key candidates, sensitivity hints, schema-drift review, version history and exports.
- **AI assistance:** generated catalog descriptions, executable pipeline SQL, ontology mappings and relationships, Home key metrics and action suggestions.
- **Pipelines and questions:** pipelines defined as node graphs (DAGs) that compile to SQL, or as editable SQL, with before and after previews. Read-only AI questions return executed results with snapshot citations.
- **Review:** evidence and query previews, bounded model repair, stale-proposal detection, atomic generation publication and definition rollback.
- **Ontology:** real ontology objects and native relationships in HelixDB, with audited edit overlays that survive rematerialisation.
- **Security:** workspace-scoped, optionally read-only, revocable API tokens, encrypted connector and model credentials, loopback host checks, and origin checks for browser changes.
- **Jobs:** persistent jobs with leases and crash recovery, scheduled source refreshes, background repair drafts, query isolation and budget controls.
- **Developer access:** OpenAPI at `/api/docs` and `/api/openapi.json`, a TypeScript SDK, definition import and export, and backup and restore scripts.

## Finding your way around

The sidebar has **Home**, **Ontology**, **Data** and **Analyst**, with **Settings** at the bottom. Switch workspaces from the menu at the top of the sidebar.

- **Home** shows the workspace's key metrics: growth and analytics metrics picked by AI from your datasets' schemas, or by code until AI is set up. They are recomputed only when an input dataset gets a new version. Ask anything about your data from the box at the top. Home also shows connections, data health, items that need attention, where you left off, and an overview of the ontology. Old dashboard links open Home.
- **Ontology** opens on the **Explorer**, which shows your records and how they connect, as a graph or a table. **Object types** lists the published business types. Open a record to see its related records and source history. Edits to a record need a before and after preview and explicit application. Workspace edits do not change imported snapshots, Home's metrics or source systems. Old `/records` links open the Explorer.
- **Data** brings every connection option into one **Add data** flow. Open a dataset to see a sample, and expand **Details** for schemas, profiles, versions, lineage, exports and connection settings. The old Advanced page now opens Data.
- **Analyst** holds your chats with the assistant. The assistant decides whether a request needs an executed answer or a tested proposal. Follow-ups keep the selected resource. Routing uses the same model-call and token budget as the rest of the run, and a saved routing decision is reused on resume when the inputs are unchanged. Read-only API tokens can investigate but cannot create definitions or change records.
- **Proposals** (`/proposals`) is where definitions from the assistant wait for review before publication. Guided setup publishes its validated build of the confirmed ontology automatically.
- **Settings** has **AI & models** (choose Local, Claude or OpenAI and enter an API key) and **Developer tools** (API tokens). Other AI settings are set through the API; see [AI and review](#ai-and-review).

## Guided setup and sample data

While a workspace's setup is incomplete, opening the app goes straight to setup. There is no account to create. Setup has three steps.

1. **AI.** Choose **Local** (the default, using `qwen3:4b`), **Claude**, **Claude (subscription)** or **OpenAI**. Claude and OpenAI need an API key, and their default models are `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `gpt-5.4-mini`. **Continue** opens the Data step straight away, and the provider is prepared in the background. For Local, the app checks the release-pinned model, downloads it through Ollama if it is missing, verifies its digest and tests structured output. If preparation fails, the later steps show the error with **Retry AI connection** and **Change AI choice**. Setup still works without AI; AI only adds descriptions.
2. **Data.** Connect your sources and let them import completely, or choose **Continue with sample data**. Nothing is seeded automatically.
3. **Ontology.** Helix Foundry computes a suggested ontology from the data: entities consolidated across sources by matching keys, and the links between them. The suggestion is deterministic. When AI is ready, a background run rewrites only its summary, descriptions and link names. Rename or exclude entities, then click **Looks right — build my workspace**. The build runs as code without model calls, shows its progress in plain stages, and publishes the workspace. Home then opens with key metrics.

Progress is saved on the server. If you close the browser, background work continues, and reopening the app returns you to the same step.

**Sample data** models Loopwell, a fictional B2B feedback and roadmap SaaS company, as it would look connected from PlanetScale, WorkOS, PostHog, Stripe and an S3 bucket. It has 11 linked datasets in which the same customers appear in every system, with realistic gaps to reconcile into one ontology: billing emails that differ from logins, help desk requests without an account, and mistyped campaign codes. The datasets are PlanetScale accounts and users; WorkOS organizations, users and SSO connections; PostHog events; Stripe customers, subscriptions and invoices; and `support_tickets.csv` and `marketing_campaigns.csv` from S3. The sample is generated on your computer, so nothing is downloaded.

The [onboarding notes](onboarding.md) list the onboarding API routes, SDK methods and import limits.

## Connecting sources

Choose **Data → Add data**, enter credentials, click **Test connection**, select tables or S3 files, and connect. You can select several tables or files in one connection, up to 100. Each selection keeps its own source record and complete snapshot. Imports must finish completely within the limits: two million streamed records, 1,000 REST pages and 256 MB per upload.

### Hosted databases: Neon, Supabase and PlanetScale

Start by choosing where your database is hosted. Provider sign-in requires registering an OAuth integration first. Without one, use a Neon API key, a Supabase personal access token or a PlanetScale service token. Database credentials stay on the server while you choose tables. Direct connections and the other source types remain available. See [hosting integration setup](HOSTING.md) for configuration and provider-specific requirements.

### PostgreSQL and MySQL

**PostgreSQL** accepts a single masked connection URL, including its database username and password; individual fields are also available. Imports use a read-only snapshot transaction and a server cursor.

**MySQL** supports configurable, verified TLS with a custom CA. Large integers and decimals are preserved as strings, and timestamps are read as strings. Transformations can cast them explicitly.

### Stripe

Stripe takes a restricted API key with read access. **Test connection** lists the objects the key can read: customers, products, prices, coupons, promotion codes, subscriptions and their items, invoices and their line items, charges, payment intents, refunds, disputes, payouts and balance transactions. Each selected object becomes its own dataset.

IDs are renamed to `<object>_id` columns (for example `customer_id`), references such as `customer` become the matching `_id` column, and Unix timestamps become ISO timestamps, so relationships line up across objects. Nested fields such as `metadata` stay as JSON. Stripe imports are complete snapshots that refresh hourly by default.

### WorkOS

WorkOS takes an API key for the environment to import. It offers organizations, users, organization memberships, invitations, SSO connections, directories, directory users, directory groups and directory group members. IDs are renamed to `<object>_id` columns; existing `organization_id`, `user_id` and `directory_id` references already match. Lists that WorkOS requires to be filtered are fetched per organization, directory or group.

### PostHog

PostHog takes a personal API key with Query Read and Project Read, plus the US, EU or self-hosted region. It offers persons (with `email` pulled out of properties), person distinct IDs, groups, events, and daily event counts per person.

Events and daily counts cover the last 30 days by default (up to 365). They are read one UTC day at a time with keyset-paged SQL queries. Identified users carry your application's user ID as a distinct ID, so `person_distinct_ids` is how PostHog people join to your users. PostHog refreshes every six hours by default.

Stripe, WorkOS and PostHog appear beside the database hosts in **Add data**.

### REST APIs, files, S3 and the ingestion API

- **REST** supports unpaginated, next-link, cursor and offset responses. Set the items path and the pagination fields to match the API.
- **S3-compatible storage** imports selected files from a bucket.
- **Uploads** accept CSV, JSON, JSONL and Parquet files up to 256 MB. Each upload becomes a durable background job, and you can choose several files together.
- **The ingestion API** (`POST /api/v1/workspaces/:w/ingest`) accepts up to 10,000 rows per request. Ingestion replaces complete snapshots; it is not an append API.

### Sync and change capture

Database imports automatically try PostgreSQL logical replication or MySQL row-binlog capture. Foundry creates its own PostgreSQL publication and slot when permitted, and never modifies server-wide settings. Native change capture coalesces committed changes into complete, bounded-memory snapshot imports, including updates, deletes and truncations. This release does not yet apply row deltas directly, so large or rapidly changing tables may lag during materialisation.

If replication is unavailable, snapshots refresh every five minutes (or on an existing UTC schedule set through the API), with a visible reason and automatic retries. REST and S3 sources also use snapshot refreshes; uploads stay explicit. Schema changes are staged for review. Business record overrides and publication protections remain separate. Writing back to sources, per-row AI enrichment and distributed compute are not supported yet.

[Operations](OPERATIONS.md) lists the database permissions change capture needs and how to manage WAL and binlog retention.

## AI and review

**Providers.** Local inference through Ollama is the default. Claude and OpenAI are explicit choices, and there is no fallback from one provider to another. Hosted keys are entered in the browser, encrypted, and tested before the provider is activated. If a replacement provider fails its test, the existing settings stay active.

**Claude with your subscription.** **Claude (subscription)** runs your own Claude Code CLI on this computer instead of calling the API with a key, so AI usage counts against your Claude Pro or Max plan. Install Claude Code and sign in with `claude` first; Helix Foundry never sees or stores your sign-in. The default model is `opus`. It works only when the API runs on your computer (`pnpm dev`), not inside Docker, and it is meant for your own use: Anthropic does not allow offering Claude subscription sign-in to other people's installations. Calls run with no tools, settings or project files, sensitive columns are masked as for other hosted providers, and the tokens Claude Code reports count against `dailyTokens`. Set `CLAUDE_BIN` if `claude` is not on the API's `PATH`.

**Context and privacy.** AI sees bounded schema, profile and sample context. Samples sent to a hosted provider mask detected sensitive columns unless `allowRawData` is set to `true` in the provider settings (an API-only setting, off by default). Detection is a heuristic, so review your source policies before using a hosted provider.

**Limits.** Local worker calls run one at a time, with two repair attempts per failing asset group. Budgets are set through the API, with `PUT /api/v1/workspaces/:w/provider` (owner only). Send `provider` and `model` along with the budgets: fields you leave out return to their defaults, a saved API key is kept when the provider does not change, and the settings are tested before they are saved.

- `maxCalls`: model calls per run, 1 to 20, default 20. Each retry of a run gets a fresh call budget.
- `timeoutSeconds`: the time budget for each run and the timeout for each model call, 30 to 1,800 seconds, default 600.
- `dailyTokens`: tokens per workspace per UTC day, 1,000 to 10,000,000, default 200,000.

**Validation.** Model-generated definitions are schema-checked and executed against the data. A passing syntax and quality check does not prove business meaning, so proposals show their assumptions and unmatched relationships for review. Guided setup publishes only what passes validation, built from the ontology you confirmed. Model quality and latency depend on your hardware and the selected model. The default Qwen digest is recorded in [`models.json`](models.json), and installation verifies it before activation.

**Publishing and rollback.** Publishing checks the exact proposal hash and input versions, then switches generations. Revalidating creates a new reviewable proposal. Rollback revalidates and rematerialises the previous definitions against current snapshots, while preserving manual actions and their audit history. Failed staging artifacts can be removed during offline maintenance, after checking that no publication references them.

## Architecture

| Service  | Responsibility                                                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App      | React UI, loopback-only API, API token checks, publication and actions        |
| Worker   | Durable AI runs, scheduled imports, pipeline execution, proactive proposals   |
| Executor | Disposable DuckDB child processes, declared inputs, isolated SELECT execution |
| HelixDB  | Workspace metadata, API tokens, jobs, proposals, ontology records and edges   |
| Ollama   | Local structured inference with persistent model storage                      |

In Docker Compose, the worker runs as its own service. In development (`pnpm dev`), it runs inside the API process. Only the app publishes a port, on `127.0.0.1`. The executor sits alone on an internal network with no outside access.

Data lives in three Docker volumes:

| Volume                       | Contents                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `helix-foundry_helix-data`   | HelixDB metadata: workspaces, ontology, jobs, API tokens and encrypted credentials |
| `helix-foundry_foundry-data` | Parquet snapshots, artifacts and staged uploads                                    |
| `helix-foundry_model-data`   | Ollama model weights (not backed up; they can be downloaded again)                 |

**HelixDB.** Queries use the HelixDB TypeScript SDK 3.2 and `/v2/query`. A scope revision is compared and advanced inside each write batch, so stale metadata writes fail as a unit. Dataset artifacts and staged ontology generations stay invisible until the publication pointer changes. Source imports remain separate from manual object overlays.

**Executor isolation.** The executor loads approved input snapshots, disables external access and extension installation, locks its configuration, and wraps generated SQL as a single SELECT. It has no connector or API credentials. Two DuckDB jobs run at a time, each with a 512 MB memory setting and a 120-second timeout. In Compose the executor container is limited to 2 GB of memory and 128 processes, drops all Linux capabilities and cannot gain new privileges. Never expose its endpoint.

## Security

Helix Foundry is local-first: one person per computer, with no accounts and no sign-in. Because of that, the API only listens on this computer.

- `HOST` must be a loopback address unless `ALLOW_NETWORK_ACCESS=true`. Compose sets that flag because it publishes the port on `127.0.0.1` only.
- Do not expose the app to a network or put it behind a reverse proxy, tunnel or port forward. HelixDB, Ollama and the executor must remain private.
- Requests whose `Host` is not a loopback name or the configured origin's host are rejected with 403, which blocks DNS-rebinding attacks. Browser changes (anything other than GET, HEAD and OPTIONS) must come from the configured origin, or its loopback equivalent on the same port.
- Requests are rate limited to 240 per minute per IP by default (`RATE_LIMIT_MAX`).
- A request without an `Authorization` header acts as the local owner. Scripts and the SDK send `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` with a token from **Settings → Developer tools**. Tokens are workspace-scoped, read-only by default and revocable. An invalid or revoked token is rejected with 401 rather than treated as the local owner.
- Connector and provider credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using a key derived from `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Losing the key makes them unrecoverable. Do not rotate it by replacing the value.

## Local development

Use Node.js 24, pnpm 10.7 and Docker. Native Ollama is optional, and useful on Apple Silicon because Docker cannot use Metal.

```sh
pnpm install
./scripts/setup.sh
# HelixDB on 6996. Use a port not occupied by another Helix project.
docker run -d --name helix-foundry-dev -p 127.0.0.1:6996:8080 \
  -e HELIX_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/helix -v helix-foundry-dev:/var/lib/helix \
  ghcr.io/helixdb/helixdb:v0.0.6@sha256:94b29942658ebdca0a91bf15edffe921a46da3e26e1223ea333ccce58c6212dd
ollama serve &   # or run it in its own terminal; skip if Ollama is already running
# Optional: the app also pulls the model when you choose Local.
ollama pull qwen3:4b
pnpm dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to the API on 3001, and the executor listens on 3002. Use 5173 rather than 3001 during development: the API may also serve an old build on 3001, and saves from it fail the origin check.

- `./scripts/setup.sh` without flags writes `.env` with development URLs (`APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173`, HelixDB on 6996, executor on 3002, Ollama on 11434) and two generated keys. It never overwrites an existing `.env`.
- `pnpm doctor` checks HelixDB, the executor, the model endpoint and the local keys, using the development URLs in `.env`. It is for development only; for a Docker install, use the in-container check in the [agent runbook](../AGENTS.md#6-verify).
- Startup applies the metadata schema idempotently; `pnpm migrate` applies it explicitly.
- `pnpm build:sdk` builds JavaScript and TypeScript declarations for the SDK and shared contracts. Run `pnpm -C packages/shared pack` and `pnpm -C packages/sdk pack` to package the client. See the [API reference](API.md) for SDK usage.
- To move the development ports, set `PORT`, `EXECUTOR_PORT`, `EXECUTOR_URL`, `APP_ORIGIN` and `HELIX_URL` in `.env`, and pass `VITE_PORT` and `API_PROXY` in the shell, because Vite does not read `.env`. Keep `APP_ORIGIN` equal to the URL Vite prints.

## Testing

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
TEST_HELIX=1 pnpm test       # requires the configured HelixDB instance
TEST_MYSQL=1 pnpm test       # fixture MySQL on localhost:33077; see tests/mysql.test.ts
pnpm build
pnpm test:browser            # starts an isolated API, executor and browser installation
ONBOARDING_LOCAL=1 pnpm exec vitest run tests/onboarding.local.test.ts   # real local Qwen check
BENCH_HTTP=1 pnpm benchmark  # 1M rows, 25 concurrent executor clients
```

- CI runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` on Node 24 for every push and pull request.
- `pnpm test` uses in-memory stores and temporary loopback ports, so it needs no running services.
- `TEST_HELIX=1` writes and then deletes a temporary scope in whatever HelixDB `HELIX_URL` points to.
- `TEST_CDC_DATABASES=1` and `TEST_ONBOARDING_DATABASES=1` enable database integration suites; see `tests/source-sync.test.ts` and `tests/onboarding-connectors.test.ts`.
- `pnpm test:browser` uses ports 3101, 3102 and 5174 with an in-memory metadata store, `.data/browser-isolated` and a deterministic provider fixture. Set `PW_SLOT` (1 to 9) to shift the ports by 10 for parallel runs.
- The benchmark needs the executor running. See [validation notes](VALIDATION.md) for recorded results.

## Backups and upgrades

```sh
./scripts/backup.sh ~/helix-foundry-backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)   # stops writers, snapshots volumes, restarts
./scripts/restore.sh ~/helix-foundry-backups/TIMESTAMP --replace
```

Backups contain the encryption key, so keep them private and outside the repository. Restore explicitly replaces the selected installation's data and `.env`. Before an upgrade, back up, keep the old commit, lockfile and image, rebuild, and run smoke checks (diagnostics, sample ingestion, a saved query and proposal validation) before using the installation again. Never remove volumes during an ordinary upgrade.

See [operations](OPERATIONS.md) for the full procedure and deployment limits, and [validation notes](VALIDATION.md) for tested coverage and current limits.
